            After a year of slavery, an infamous teenage assassin named Celaena is 
            given the chance to become the tyrannical king's personal assassin/King's 
            Champion by representing Prince Dorian in a competition against the most 
            gifted thieves and assassins in the land. She must survive every test and 
            trial in order to proceed to the final, in which she has to fight her 
            remaining opponents. As candidates are found dead in the castle, their 
            bodies ruptured, Celaena finds herself delving deep into mysteries 
            concerning not only her, but her very own ancestors and the creatures 
            of darkness that dwell deep beneath the castle.

            With every death she fakes, she puts her close friends at risk. Celaena 
            must choose between a captain and a prince, and must battle forces more 
            threatening than the king. She also reunites with an old colleague, 
            becomes obsessed with a rebel movement, and learns more about the king's 
            source of power.

            Stronger than ever, Aelin Galathynius (aka Celaena Sardothien) returns to Rifthold, 
            this time as a free woman. Upon her return, she learns that much has changed since 
            she left, including the capture of her long-lost cousin Aedion and the possession 
            of her friend Dorian at the hands of a Valg Prince. Aelin teams up with Chaol's 
            team of rebels and her former master, King of Assassins Arobynn Hamel, determined 
            to get her revenge for over ten years of pain, by freeing magic, killing the King 
            of Adarlan, and rescuing Dorian. Across Adarlan in Morath, Manon is forced to use

            the world, but with so many sworn enemies in want of revenge, including 
            Queen Maeve of the Fae, survival seems unlikely. Aelin begins to realize 
            that there are events in her life which may not have happened by coincidence; 
            in fact, many have been pulling strings in the background long before she was 
            born, and that she was destined for something far greater than she thought.
